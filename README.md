  Library Management System
</h2>

<br/>

<p>The Library Management System is a browser-based system that is used to store, retrieve, 
update, and delete book records. When a user borrows the book from the library, the Library 
Management System can retrieve the information of the book and update it in such a way that 
the book is no longer available in the list of stored books until the user returns the book to the 
library. The Library Management System also has a delete function in a case whereby the book is 
no longer available in the library.</p><br/>

<p>There are two types of users for The Library Management System - Normal user & Administrator</p>

<p><b>For the examples of user interface in this system, can refer to master branch</b>b</p>
